## Career Objectives

I would like to do well in my internship this coming summer. If I impress my supervisors, then I hope it will allow me to move from commercial banking to investment banking and also move from Houston to New York for the following summer, after I graduate. My goal is to be a reliable employee and co-worker, who others can come to for help. Another goal of mine is to support and raise a family and move back to Houston when that time comes. 

I continously prove dependability and value to those who count on me through my hard work. I beleive I am a good person to have around.
